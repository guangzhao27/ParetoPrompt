# Overview

This repository contains the code for our paper on Pareto Prompt Optimization, which introduces a novel approach to optimizing prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) under multiple competing objectives. The method leverages multi-objective optimization techniques to balance factors such as accuracy, conciseness, and computational cost.
